# React exercise: Hacker News
A simple app that allows a user to search the Hacker News Algolia API and display a list of results.

## Technologies Used
I used the following technologies: HTML, CSS, React, and Redux.

## Installation and Setup
1. Fork [repo](https://github.com/amberkhan1028/react-exercise.git)
2. Clone your forked repo into your file system
3. Run npm install to install dependencies npm install
4. Start the server by running  **npm start** in the project directory. The app will open automatically in your browser. 
5. That's it! Enjoy :~)
